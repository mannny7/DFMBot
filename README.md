Download the files, extract the zip file

Open a new command prompt window ( Press Windows + R and type in `cmd` and press enter)

Copy it and use it in the command

So in this example I'd type into the command prompt `cd C:\Users\manny\Downloads\DFMBot-main (1)\DFMBot-main`

Now type `pip install -r requirements.txt` 

If you get an error about pip not being installed google a tutorial on how to install pip (it basically comes included when installing python so make sure you have python downloaded)

If all goes well now type `python main.py` this will run the python script.

Try to do some problem solving yourself but if you need anymore help message me on Discord `Manny.#0001`
